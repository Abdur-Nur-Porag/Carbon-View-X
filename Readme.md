## About

Carbon View X provides prebuilt components and assets to accelerate UI development.

## Prebuilt components and assets

All prebuilt items are indexed in the prebuilt folder. See the full list and direct links here:

- Prebuilt index: [prebuilt/PREBUILT.md](./Doc/preBuilt.md)

(That index contains direct links to every file inside the `prebuilt/` directory for quick access.)

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies (if any)
3. Explore `prebuilt/` for ready-to-use components and assets
